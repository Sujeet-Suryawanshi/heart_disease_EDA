Based on the analysis of the dataset, several conclusions can be drawn:

1. Chest Pain Type:
   The distribution of chest pain types, such as typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, and asymptomatic, was analyzed.
   It was found that a higher number of males are suffering from angina type of chest pain.

3. Resting Blood Pressure Distribution:
    The distribution of resting blood pressure (trestbps) was visualized, showing the distribution of blood pressure levels among individuals with and without heart disease.

4. Cholesterol Distribution:
   The distribution of cholesterol levels (chol) was visualized, showing the distribution of cholesterol levels among individuals with and without heart disease.

5. Age Distribution:
    The age distribution of the individuals in the dataset was analyzed, with the minimum age being 29, the maximum age being 77, and the mean age being 54.43.
    The dataset was further categorized into young age, middle age, and old age groups.

6. Gender Distribution:
    The dataset contains a higher number of males (713) compared to females (312).

7. Heart Disease Distribution:
     The dataset contains 499 individuals without heart disease and 526 individuals with heart disease.

8. Correlations:
     A correlation heatmap was generated to analyze the relationships between different factors such as age, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, and the presence of heart disease.


9.  The analysis revealed that there is a higher prevalence of heart disease in the dataset, with a slightly higher percentage of individuals having heart disease compared to those without.
    Additionally, factors such as cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, and gender may play a role in the presence of heart disease.
    Further analysis and modeling may be required to gain deeper insights and make more accurate predictions.
